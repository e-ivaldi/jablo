# jablo
A port of the diablo engine (sort of) written in javascript (using the browser as environment!) inspired by the freeablo project code at https://github.com/wheybags/freeablo.
A path named "mpq" that serves "some extracted files" is expected to exist at the same level as the index.html and jablo.js files in order for Jablo to "work".
I am personally accessing the index.html using nginx as a http server.

At the current status of development Jablo is nothing more than a remote call to get a palette file and create an object to represent it, more stuff is going to be added, eventually.
